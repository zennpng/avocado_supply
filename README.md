### Contents 
- main code in [analysis_full.py](https://github.com/zennpng/avocado_supply/blob/master/analysis_full.py)
- xlsx and csv files provided, code also produces those files  
- Key plots includes as jpg files  
- pip install -r requirements.txt 

### Project Action Plan
The first step was to clean and prepare the market data. This was done by grouping the avocados based on their types and splitting the data into training data (2015-2017) and test data (2018). We also used the QGIS software to visualise geographic locations in the dataset.   

We then performed statistical analysis of the demand distribution for the different regions and avocado types using Chi2 normality test, D’Agostino’s k-squared test and Shapiro-Wilk test in order to determine if they are normally distributed.   

Next, we applied the Newsvendor model to determine the optimal weekly supply quantity to each region for normally distributed demand data and the percentile method for non-normal demand distribution.   

Finally, we compared the profits generated by 3 strategies - no risk pooling, risk pooling by states, and risk pooling by distance (using K means clustering method to find optimal number of distribution centres) to determine the best strategy for avocados distribution.

### Results
Using‌ ‌the‌ ‌optimal‌ ‌quantity‌ ‌of‌ ‌each‌ ‌type‌ ‌of‌ ‌avocado‌ ‌to‌ ‌supply‌ ‌to‌ ‌each‌ ‌region‌ ‌in‌ ‌each‌ ‌week‌ ‌(Q*),‌ ‌we‌ ‌ explored‌ ‌3‌ ‌possible‌ ‌ways‌ ‌of‌ ‌avocado‌ ‌distribution:   
- Supplying‌ ‌regions‌ ‌directly   
- Risk-pooling‌ ‌by‌ ‌States   
- Risk-pooling‌ ‌by‌ ‌Distance   

We‌ ‌found‌ ‌that‌ ‌Risk-pooling‌ ‌by‌ ‌Distance‌ ‌was‌ ‌the‌ ‌most‌ ‌profitable‌ ‌ from‌ ‌our‌ ‌analysis‌ ‌and‌ ‌is‌ ‌thus‌ ‌the‌ ‌recommended‌ ‌approach‌ ‌to‌ ‌distributing‌ ‌avocadoes‌ ‌to‌ ‌regions‌ ‌in‌ ‌the‌ ‌US.‌
